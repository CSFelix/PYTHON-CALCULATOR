# 🌟 CALCULATOR 🌟

----

### `❓ What's it? ❓`
* Calculator is a terminal where you can do some calculations using the math package. Also, I developed a lambda function that calculates the average value of a list. Follow the code:

```
avg = lambda x: sum(x) / len(x)
```

* Some suggests and improvements, please, tell me!!! And don't worry about my English, I'm earlier (or noob, whatever) in this language 😂😂.

----
### `⚒️ Tools ⚒️`
* Python 3.5 version or later

----
### `⚙️ Run ⚙️`
* Download *calculadora-beta.py* file;
* Open the *computer's terminal*;
* Go to the file's directory. Suppose that my file is in *Code* folder storaged in 'C' disk, so, tip it in the terminal:

```
cd C:\Code
```

* Tip:

```
python calculadora-beta.py
```

### `📝 Examples 📝`
* Try out some calcs and commands. Here are some them:

```
dir(math)
help(sum)
avg([1, 0, 5])
sum([x for x in range(1,5)])
```
